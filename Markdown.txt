# Data Preprocessing Summary

1. *Loaded the dataset** with `;` as the delimiter and skipped bad lines.
2. *Removed rows with missing critical information**, such as title, year, rating, and actor data.
3. *Dropped duplicate rows**, keeping the first occurrence.
4. *Converted runtime** values like "142 min" to integers.
5. *Extracted decade** from the release year (e.g., 1994 → "1990s").
6. *Created a combined Lead_Actors column** by merging Star1–Star4.

These steps helped standardize the data and make it ready for analysis.
